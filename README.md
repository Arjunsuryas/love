    Love is a feeling so pure and true,
    It's the joy in the morning and the sky so blue.
    It's the spark in the eyes, the warmth in the heart,
    A bond that connects, even when we're apart.
    
    Love is not bound by time or space,
    It's the strength that helps us embrace.
    So here's to love, in all its glory,
    The magic that writes our life's story.
